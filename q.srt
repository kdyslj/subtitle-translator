00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,641
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

4
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,962
You're going out with a guy.

5
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,521
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,723
All right, Joey, be nice.

7
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,532
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

8
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,366
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

9
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,644
I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

10
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,405
Okay, everybody relax.

11
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:18,449
Relax. This is not even a date.

12
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:22,480
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

13
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,971
Sounds like a date to me.

14
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,451
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

15
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,684
. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

16
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,850
I've had that dream.

17
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,721
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

18
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,125
. . .there.

19
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,004
-Instead of--
-That's right!

20
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,811
That one, I've never had.

21
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:52,204
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

22
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,290
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,363
They weren't looking at you before?

24
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,725
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

25
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,332
And it turns out it's my mother.

26
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:10,326
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

27
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:22,531
This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

28
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,281
You okay, sweetie?
